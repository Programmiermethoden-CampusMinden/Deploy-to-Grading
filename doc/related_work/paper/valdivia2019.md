## Abstract

This research has used Git, software for Version Control, as well as the GitLab web platform for teaching programming collaboratively, which has strengthened collaborative learning in the classroom, a skill that for a long time was a very alternative important for team teaching of programming courses in engineering schools; The use of the Git tool helped the teacher to improve the teaching of programming and allowed through the GitLab platform for students to interact and develop the skills of critical thinking, teamwork, correcting and teaching to program low-performance students, the results of the capacities were visualized and quantified through the reports delivered by the GitLab web platform.

## Notizen

Das Paper nennt Erfahrungen bei der Verwendung von Git in Programmierkursen. Der beschriebene Ablauf ist vergleichbar mit dem aktuellen Abgabeprozess in PM, wobei alles auf einer sehr einfachen Ebene bleibt (clone, add, commit, push).
