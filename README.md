# Deploy-to-Grading

Deploy-to-Grading (D2G) is a toolchain for automated analysis and grading of programming tasks. Contrary to other popular solutions, it uses freely available computing resources and is based on Git. Currently, only tools for grading Java assignments are implemented.


## Usage

For information on how to use D2G, take a look at the [documentation (in german)](doc/readme.md).


## Contributing

Questions, bug reports, feature requests and pull requests are very welcome.
